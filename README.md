# BloopyBoi

BloopyBoi Redux

This is a golang rewrite/continuation of the python [bloopyboi](https://github.com/h3mmy/bloopyboi) with some additional functionality added.
Designed with [bloopysphere](https://github.com/h3mmy/bloopysphere) in mind, but once more developed it should be adaptable for anyone's cluster.
This is still a work in progress, so if you have suggestions for future functionality, open a discussion!

## Description

Bot that can be linked to a discord server. Is able to register slash commands and DMs. Includes a command to generate an inspirobot image.

Runs in a container, and comes with a helm chart for k8s integration (WIP)

## Authors and acknowledgment

Workflows initially templated from [bjw-s/helm-charts](https://github.com/bjw-s/helm-charts) and [onedr0p/containers](https://github.com/onedr0p/containers) so I could butcher them here.
